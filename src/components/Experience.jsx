            <h3>Course Assistant</h3>
            <p>
                While attending UW-Madison, I worked at the Math Learning Center (MLC). 
                I was a Course Assistant for Number Theory, Combinatorics, and Cryptography.
                In my role I had various responsibilities including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Holding weekly office hours to help students by explaining important concepts 
                    and helping solve practice problems/homework questions.</li>
                <li>Communicating with professors to update them on how students were doing, identify
                    areas that students struggled with, and discuss how we could improve going forward.
                </li>
                <li>Communicating with colleagues to ensure shifts were filled in case of emergencies and to
                    compare observations to collectively improve our office hours.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
