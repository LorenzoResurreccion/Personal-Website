            <h3>Course Assstant</h3>
            <p>
                While attending UW-Madison, I worked in the Math Learning Center (MLC). 
                For the MLC I was a Course Assistant for Number Theory, Combinatorics, and Cryptography.
                In my role I had various responsibilities including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Holding weekly office hours to help students by explaining important concepts 
                    and helping solve practice problems/homework questions</li>
                <li>Communicated with professors to update on how students were doing and to identify
                    areas that students struggled with and how we could improve going forward
                </li>
                <li>Communicate with colleagues to ensure shifts were filled if emergencies came up and 
                    so that we could compare our observations and collectively improve our office hours
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This helped me develop various skills including: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ability to breakdown and explain complex problems simply to multiple people with various levels of understanding</li>
                <li>Ability to view the same problem in various ways and solve it using different perspectivs/approaches</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
