            <p>
                I grew up in Apple Valley, MN with two parents and an older sister. Both of my parents are sofware developers, so 
                they often pushed me to try programming. After taking one class, I was hooked and decided to pursue it as a career. 
                I graduated from UW-Madison in Fall 2024 with a Bachelors of Science Degree, double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.

                In my free time I enjoy crocheting, completing jigsaw puzzles, and playing video games or board games with friends.
                I'm also a major foodie and love trying new foods whenever I can. I also like to stay healthy/active by lifting and playing basketball.
