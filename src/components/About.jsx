            <p>
                I grew up in Apple Valley, MN with two parents and an older sister. Both my parents are sofware developers so 
                when they pushed me to try programming, I found it very interesting. I graduated from UW-Madison with a Bachelors of Science Degree, 
                double majorinig in Computer Science and Mathematics

                In my free time I enjoy crocheting, completing jigsaw puzzles, and playing video games or board games with friends.
                I'm also a major foodie and love trying new foods whenever I can. I also enjoy lifting and playing basketball.
